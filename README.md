ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a passionate .Net Developer and Architect with extensive experience in designing and building scalable, high-performance applications. My expertise spans across Azure and AWS cloud services, where I have architected and deployed robust solutions to solve complex business challenges.

Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into the exciting world of Generative AI and have developed applications using LangChain and Python FastAPI, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create innovative AI-driven solutions.

My technical interests include:

Cloud-Native Development (Azure, AWS)
API Development with .Net Core, FastAPI
Generative AI and Natural Language Processing
Event-Driven Architectures using MassTransit, RabbitMQ, SQS, and SNS
Containerization and Orchestration with Docker, Docker Compose & .Net Aspire

I enjoy exploring new trends in technology and contributing to open-source projects. Feel free to check out my repositories, where I share technical experiments, tools, and project implementations.

Letâ€™s collaborate and innovate! ðŸŒŸ
